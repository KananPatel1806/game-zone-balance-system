# game-zone-balance-system
A console-based Python application simulating a prepaid Game Zone system where users can select games, manage their balance, and top up as needed. Demonstrates conditional logic, loops, and user input handling.



This Python program simulates a Game Zone where users can play games based on their available balance. The user is first welcomed and asked to enter their initial balance. A menu-driven interface then allows the user to select from four gamesâ€”Bowling, Chess, Ludo, and Riding, each having a fixed cost. Once a game is selected, the program checks whether the user's current balance is sufficient. If so, the user is allowed to play, and the game price is deducted from the balance. If the balance is insufficient, the system prompts the user to top up their balance before continuing. After each transaction, the user is given the choice to either continue playing or exit the game zone. This project demonstrates practical usage of conditional statements, loops, and user input handling, simulating real-world prepaid game systems where balance and transaction flow need to be managed efficiently.
